    <a name="abs"></a><h3>Abstract</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Neuronal synaptic junction protein <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin (<em>CTNND2</em>) is often overexpressed in prostatic adenocarcinomas but the mechanisms of its activation are unknown. To address this question,
   we studied the hypothesis that Hes1, human homolog of <em>Drosophila </em><u>H</u>airy and <u>e</u>nhancer of <u>s</u>plit (Hes) 1, is a transcriptional repressor of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression and plays an important role in molecular carcinogenesis.
</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>We identified that, using a <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter reporter assay, Hes1, but not its inactive mutant, significantly repressed the upregulation of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase
   activities induced by E2F1. Hes1 binds directly to the E-boxes on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter and can reduce the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostate cancer cells. In prostate cancer CWR22-Rv1 and PC3 cell lines,
   which showed distinct <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin overexpression, E2F1 and Hes1 expression pattern was altered. The suppression of Hes1 expression,
   either by <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase inhibitors or by siRNA against Hes1, increased <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression. <span class="entity">γ</span>-Secretase inhibition delayed
   S/G2-phase transition during cell cycle progression and induced cell shape changes to extend cellular processes in prostate
   cancer cells. In neuroendocrine prostate cancer mouse model derived allograft NE-10 tumors, <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin showed an increased
   expression while Hes1 expression was diminished. Furthermore, <em>E2F1 </em>transcription was very high in subgroup of NE-10 tumors in which <em>Hes1 </em>still displayed residual expression, while its expression was only moderately increased in NE-10 tumors where Hes1 expression
   was completely suppressed.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>These studies support coordinated regulation of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression by both the activating transcription factor E2F1 and
   repressive transcription factor Hes1 in prostate cancer progression.
</p>
<a name="sec1"></a><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Deregulation of gene expression is one of the most prominent features of cancer. Upregulated or downregulated genes interfere
   with signaling pathways leading to altered cell functions. Thus, the elucidation of different mechanisms responsible for changes
   in gene expression is essential for the understanding of tumorigenesis.
</p>
<p><span class="entity">δ</span>-Catenin (<em>CTNND2</em>) or NPRAP (neural plakophilin-related arm-repeat protein) was first identified with its primary expression in neural and
   neuroendocrine tissues <a name="d11647e241"></a>[<a href="#B1">1</a>]. Many studies showed that <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression is tightly controlled, and the alteration of its expression level is associated
   with a number of human diseases. The hemizygous deletion of <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>gene is associated with the severe mental retardation phenotype of Cri-du-Chat syndrome <a name="d11647e248"></a>[<a href="#B2">2</a>]. On the other hand, increased <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression modifies adhesion molecules, reshapes cellular morphology, and promotes
   cell migration <a name="d11647e252"></a><a name="d11647e254"></a>[<a href="#B3">3</a>,<a href="#B4">4</a>]. Most strikingly, <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin was found to be overexpressed in several cancers of peripheral tissues, including prostate, esophagus,
   and breast tumors <a name="d11647e259"></a>[<a href="#B5">5</a>], and upregulated in the majority of prostatic adenocarcinomas <a name="d11647e263"></a>[<a href="#B6">6</a>]. Overexpressed <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin can be detected in urine and is accumulated significantly in prostate cancer patients <a name="d11647e267"></a>[<a href="#B7">7</a>]. Increased expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin disrupts cell-cell junctions <a name="d11647e271"></a><a name="d11647e273"></a>[<a href="#B3">3</a>,<a href="#B6">6</a>] and promotes human prostate cancer cell growth and tumor progression, altering cell cycle and survival gene profiles <a name="d11647e277"></a>[<a href="#B8">8</a>].
</p>
<p>Increased expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in carcinogenesis is modulated by multiple mechanisms, including gene amplification, transcriptional
   activation, and mutation in its non-coding region <a name="d11647e283"></a>[<a href="#B9">9</a>]. It was reported that E2F1 positively regulates the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in human prostate cancer cells <a name="d11647e287"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>], and the expression of both genes is altered in prostate cancer <a name="d11647e291"></a><a name="d11647e293"></a>[<a href="#B6">6</a>,<a href="#B11">11</a>]. On the other hand, Hes1, human homolog of <em>Drosophila </em><u>H</u>airy and <u>e</u>nhancer of <u>s</u>plit 1, and a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor, shows potential binding sites on human <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter region near that of E2F1 <a name="d11647e312"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>]. Hes1 is a target gene of Notch1 activation, which is believed to be critical for the development of prostate cancer <a name="d11647e316"></a><a name="d11647e318"></a>[<a href="#B12">12</a>,<a href="#B13">13</a>]. In transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer, NE-10 prostate tumor from subcutaneous transplantation of 12T-10 tumor and
   CR2-TAg prostate, Notch-Hes1 signaling is down-regulated and may be responsible for the promotion of the neuroendocrine differentiation
   of prostate cancer cells <a name="d11647e322"></a><a name="d11647e324"></a>[<a href="#B14">14</a>,<a href="#B15">15</a>].
</p>
<p><span class="entity">δ</span>-Catenin is upregulated in human prostate cancer <a name="d11647e330"></a>[<a href="#B6">6</a>], and Hes1 expression is altered in tumorigenesis <a name="d11647e334"></a><a name="d11647e336"></a>[<a href="#B16">16</a>,<a href="#B17">17</a>]. However, the ability of Hes1 to inhibit the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostate cancer cells and the cooperation between
   Hes1 and other transcription factors for modulating <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in prostate development and tumorigenesis are still
   unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that Hes1 is a transcriptional repressor for <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>and regulates <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in human prostate cancer cells and mouse models of prostate tumors by coordinating with
   transcription activator E2F1.
</p>
<a name="sec2"></a><h3>Results</h3>
<h4>Hes1 inhibits the upregulation of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase activities induced by E2F1 in prostate cancer cells</h4>
<p>Human <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter region contains multiple potential binding sites for positive or negative regulators revealed by Genomatix program
   <a href="http://www.genomatix.de/">http://www.genomatix.de/</a> <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query.php?url=http://www.genomatix.de/&amp;refdoi=10.1186/1476-4598-9-304" alt="" title="Archive copy of webpage" class="xpushbutton">webcite</a><a name="d11647e358"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>]. Among them, E2F1 has been identified as a positive regulator of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells. On the other
   hand, Hes1 was predicted to have several binding sites near the binding sites of E2F1 on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter (Figure <a name="d11647e364"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1A</a>). BK1 and BK5 were two <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase reporter vectors, containing 2664 bp and 744 bp of <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter, respectively. When co-transfected with <em>E2F1 </em>expression vector, <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase activities were dramatically increased in prostate cancer cell lines <a name="d11647e375"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>]. To test the hypothesis that Hes1 is a negative regulator of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression, we co-transfected <em>Hes1 </em>expression vectors (<em>pcDNA-flag-WT-Hes1 </em>or <em>pcDNA-flag-DN-Hes1</em>) and <em>E2F1</em>, together with <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter vectors BK1 or BK5, into CWR22-Rv1 or PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell lines. As shown in Figure <a name="d11647e394"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1B</a>, E2F1 induced dramatic increases in <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase activities in both cell lines with either BK1 or BK5 co-transfection.
   After co-transfection with <em>WT-Hes1 </em>expression vector, E2F1-induced <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase activities were completely blocked in both cell lines (Figure <a name="d11647e400"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1B</a>). We then applied a dominant negative mutant Hes1 (<em>DN-Hes1</em>), where amino acids E43, K44, and R47 in the basic region were each mutated to A. Literature indicated that DN-Hes1 cannot
   bind to DNA but can still dimerize with the endogenous WT-Hes1 to form a non-DNA-binding heterodimer complex <a name="d11647e407"></a>[<a href="#B18">18</a>]. DN-Hes1 led to a moderate reduction in E2F1-induced <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase expression in PC3 (Figure <a name="d11647e411"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1B</a>) that did not reach statistical significance. No change was found in CWR22-Rv1 cells (Figure <a name="d11647e414"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1B</a>). The negative effects of <em>Hes1 </em>on <em>E2F1</em>-induced <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase activities were dose-dependent (Figure <a name="d11647e423"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1C</a>). Furthermore, when Hes1 expression was kept constant, increasing E2F1 expression also showed dose-dependent changes in <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase
   activities (Figure <a name="d11647e426"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1D</a>). These results demonstrated that Hes1 can functionally interact with E2F1 in controlling <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in prostate
   cancer cells.

<h4>Hes1 interacts with <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin promoter</h4>
<p>To explore whether Hes1 suppresses <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression by directly binding to <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-Catenin </em>promoter contains several E-boxes and N-boxes (Figure <a name="d11647e482"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1A</a>). We applied biotin to label and prepare a 60 bp dsDNA oligonucleotide probe (marked as ** in Figure <a name="d11647e485"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1A</a>) spanning one E-box. Nuclear extracts were prepared from PC3 or CWR22-Rv1 cells that were transiently transfected with Hes1
   for 24 hours. EMSA demonstrated a clearly shifted protein-DNA complex after incubating the labeled probes with nuclear extracts
   from cells overexpressing WT-Hes1 (Figure <a name="d11647e488"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2A</a>, lane 2, and arrow). This shift was also observed when the E-box was mutated in the unlabeled probes and incubated with nuclear
   extracts of cells overexpressing WT-Hes1 (Figure <a name="d11647e492"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2A</a>, lane 3, arrow). Competition experiments showed that the unlabeled <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter sequences applied at low dose reduced Hes1 protein<em>-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter complexes (Figure <a name="d11647e501"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2A</a>, lane 4, arrow), whereas that of high dose completely inhibited the Hes1 protein<em>-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter complexes (Figure <a name="d11647e507"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2A</a>, lane 5, arrow). To determine whether Hes1 was responsible for the formation of the shifted protein-DNA complexes, we added
   anti-Hes1 antibody into the nuclear extracts followed by the gel-shift immunoassays. After incubating Hes1-overexpressed nuclear
   extracts with anti-Hes1 antibody before the addition of DNA probe, protein-DNA complexes related to Hes1<em>-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter disappeared (Figure <a name="d11647e514"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2A</a>, lane 6, arrow). In other experiments, incubation of nuclear extracts with normal IgG or antibodies against non-relevant
   proteins did not reduce shifted bands (data not shown). When anti-Hes1 was added after the probe was incubated with the nuclear
   extracts, the slowest moving protein-DNA complexes were disrupted. However, under this experimental condition, supershifts
   did not occur but the partially disrupted protein-DNA complex can be detected (Figure <a name="d11647e517"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2A</a>, lane 7, double arrows).

   the binding of protein-DNA complexes; lane 6-7, gel shift immune-assays were performed with the same labeled probe using an
   anti-Hes1 antibody. Incubating Hes1-overexpressed nuclear extracts with anti-Hes1 antibody before the addition of probe DNA
   inhibited protein-DNA complexes (lane 6). Incubating Hes1-overexpressed nuclear extracts with anti-Hes1 antibody after the
   addition of probe DNA disrupted the slowest moving protein-DNA complexes (lane 7, arrow). However, under this experimental
   condition, supershifts did not occur but the partially disrupted protein-DNA complex resulting fast moving band accumulation
   can be detected (lane 7, double arrows). (B) Anti-Hes1 chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of the <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter. Real-time qRT-PCR showed the signal relative to input chromatin. Compared with the negative control experiment using
   IgG, anti-Hes1 greatly recruited the <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter DNA. Anti-Histone H3 ChIP was performed as a positive control. *: <em>p </em>&lt; 0.05. (C) Hes1 binding to E-boxes on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter is important to negatively regulate E2F1 induced <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity. Note: E2F1 expression elicited a strong <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity in PC3 cells, whatever BK5 sequence was mutated (*<em>p </em>&gt; 0.05). But when WT-Hes1 co-transfection with E2F1, it significantly suppressed E2F1 induced <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity when wild type <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter sequence BK5 was employed compared to BK5 sequence mutated vector (*<em>p &lt;</em>0.05).
</p></div>
</div>
<p>We have also performed the ChIP assay to further examine the interaction of endogenous Hes1 protein with <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter. The signal relative to input chromatin revealed by real-time PCR showed that anti-Hes1 recruited the <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter DNA to the similar levels to the positive control using anti-Histone 3 (Figure <a name="d11647e579"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2B</a>). These combined results including EMSA and CHIP demonstrated that endogenous as well as ectopically transfected Hes1 protein
   is capable of direct binding to the <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter.
</p>
<p>Additionally, to determine whether Hes1 binding domain on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter is functional, we examined the ability of Hes1 protein to inhibit <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity when selective, putative Hes1 binding E-boxes on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter were mutated (Figure <a name="d11647e596"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2C</a>). As shown in Figure <a name="d11647e599"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2C</a>, E2F1 expression elicited a strong <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity in PC3 cells, whether the BK5 sequence was mutated or not. WT-Hes1 co-transfection with E2F1 significantly
   suppressed E2F1 induced <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity when wild type <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter sequence BK5 was employed. However, the ability of WT-Hes1 to suppress E2F-1 induced <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter activity was reduced when BK5 sequence was mutated (<em>p </em>&lt; 0.05) (Figure <a name="d11647e618"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F2">2C</a>). Therefore, Hes1 was able to bind to <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter and repress its activity through E-boxes, although other potential Hes1 binding sites may play additional suppressive
   roles on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter.

<h4>Prostate cancer cell lines display altered expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin and its potential transcription regulators</h4>
<p>Our previous studies demonstrated <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin upregulation in prostate cancer by both RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry <a name="d11647e635"></a>[<a href="#B6">6</a>]. Overexpression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostatic adenocarcinomas could be due to increased activities of its positive transcriptional
   regulators and/or decreased activities of its negative transcriptional regulators. To further exploit the potential transcriptional
   regulators of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostate cancer cells, we applied RT-PCR to compare the expression patterns of potential transcription
   factors in CWR22-Rv1 and PC3, two prostate cancer cell lines that show distinctly higher <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression compared to
   the non-cancer prostate epithelial cell line PZ-HPV-7 (Figure <a name="d11647e638"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F3">3A</a>, <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin). Coincident with <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression, <em>E2F1 </em>expression correlated very well with CWR22-Rv1 and PC3 while it was barely detected in PZ-HPV-7 (Figure <a name="d11647e644"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F3">3A</a>, E2F1). <em>Hes1 </em>expression was clearly detected in all of these cell lines. <em>Hey1</em>, another <em>Hes </em>related family of bHLH type transcriptional repressors, had a similar transcript distribution pattern in these cells compared
   with that of <em>Hes1 </em>(Figure <a name="d11647e660"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F3">3A</a>, Hes1 and Hey1). Real-time qRT-PCR confirmed the RT-PCR results (Figure <a name="d11647e663"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F3">3B</a>). Pax6, another known positive transcription factor for <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em><a name="d11647e670"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>], showed similar changes to <em>E2F1 </em>in CWR22-Rv1 cells and PC3 cells compared with PZ-HPV-7 cells (Figure <a name="d11647e676"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F3">3</a>, Pax6). The expression of p53 and androgen receptor (AR) did not show clear correlation with <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>expression. These data indicate that E2F1 and Hes1 may influence <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>transcript level in prostate cancer PC3 or CWR22-Rv1 cells.

<h4>Overexpression of Hes1 can reduce the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostate cancer cells</h4>
<p>We then examined whether ectopic overexpression of <em>Hes1 </em>can act as a negative regulator of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells. When <em>pcDNA-flag-WT-Hes1 </em>was transfected into CWR22-Rv1 cells, both <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin mRNA and protein levels were reduced dramatically compared to control
   and <em>DN-Hes1 </em>(Figure <a name="d11647e744"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F4">4A</a> and <a name="d11647e747"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F4">4B</a>). The same trends can be observed in PC3 cells, however the reduction of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin mRNA and protein was more moderate (only

<p>We then applied immunofluorescence light microscopy to investigate the expression and distribution of Hes1 and <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in
   CWR22-Rv1 and PC3 cells. Anti-flag-M5 antibody for flag-tagged Hes1 did not stain control, untransfected cells as expected
   (Figure <a name="d11647e822"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F5">5A</a>) but labeled strongly the nuclei when Hes1 was overexpressed in CWR22-Rv1 cells (Figure <a name="d11647e825"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F5">5B</a> and N, arrows). CWR22-Rv1 cells were clustered so we applied marking lines to better reveal the cell-cell boundary (Figure

Anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin stained cytoplasm and cell-cell contacts in untransfected cells (Figure <a name="d11647e834"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F5">5D</a>), but the transfected cells showed a decreased intensity of anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin immunoreactivity (Figure <a name="d11647e838"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F5">5E</a> and N, arrows) when compared with the nearby untransfected cells (Figure <a name="d11647e841"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F5">5E</a>, arrowheads). The same results were obtained in PC3 cells that the overexpression of Hes1 reduced the anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin immunoreactivity
   (Figure <a name="d11647e844"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F6">6B</a>, E and N, arrows and arrowheads). However, when dominant negative Hes1 (<em>pcDNA-flag-DN-Hes1</em>) was transfected in either CWR22-Rv1 cells or PC3 cells, its inhibitory effects on the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin were very
   weak, comparable to that of control, untransfected cells (Figure <a name="d11647e850"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F5">5</a> and <a name="d11647e853"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F6">6</a>, C, F and O, compare arrows and arrowheads). Combined with the RT-PCR and Western blot data (Figure <a name="d11647e857"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F4">4</a>), these studies suggest that overexpression of wild type Hes1 can reduce the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostate cancer cells.

<h4>Suppression of endogenous Hes1 expression increases <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells</h4>
<p>It was reported that <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase inhibitor DAPT reduced Hes1 level in two prostate tumor cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP, in a dose-dependent
   manner <a name="d11647e911"></a>[<a href="#B19">19</a>]. After being treated with 20 <span class="entity">μ</span>M DAPT for 48 h, Hes1 expression showed a decreasing trend at both the mRNA and protein level
   in PC3 cells (Figure <a name="d11647e914"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7A</a> and <a name="d11647e917"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7B</a>). Correspondingly, <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin mRNA and protein levels in PC3 cells increased markedly (Figure <a name="d11647e920"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7A</a> and <a name="d11647e923"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7B</a>). The changes of <em>E2F1 </em>mRNA expression were less clear in PC3 cells (Figure <a name="d11647e930"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7B</a>). These results were consistent with the notion that the relief of inhibitory function of Hes1 by DAPT may increase the <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin
   expression in PC3 cells.

<p>In CWR22-Rv1 cells, treatment with 20 <span class="entity">μ</span>M DAPT for 48 h also reduced Hes1 expression but with little changes in <em>E2F1 </em>expression; the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in transcript and protein levels only showed a slight increase (Figure <a name="d11647e989"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7C</a> and <a name="d11647e992"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7D</a>, <em>p </em>&lt; 0.05). To directly test the hypothesis that a reduction of Hes1 can lead to increases in <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression, we applied

Real-time PCR clearly showed that depletion of <em>Hes1 </em>mRNA increased <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>transcript level by over 6-fold (Figure <a name="d11647e1014"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7F</a>).

<h4>
<span class="entity">δ</span>-Catenin shows a coordinated expression with E2F1 and Hes1 in NE-10 mouse model of prostate cancer</h4>
<p>NE-10 is a tumor derivative allograft from the neuroendocrine prostate cancer mouse model 12T-10 <a name="d11647e1024"></a>[<a href="#B20">20</a>]. Previous reports showed that compared to the normal mouse prostate, Hes1 expression was suppressed in NE-10 tumors <a name="d11647e1028"></a>[<a href="#B14">14</a>]. This was confirmed in our studies (Figure <a name="d11647e1031"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8A</a>, left panel). Both RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry also showed that <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin immunoreactivity was increased in NE-10 tumors
   when compared to that of normal prostate (Figure <a name="d11647e1034"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8A</a>, left and right panels). To determine whether a coordinated regulation of E2F1 with Hes1 on <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression occurs <em>in vivo</em>, we have sought to compare the changes of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression along with <em>Hes1 </em>and <em>E2F1 </em>expression in NE-10 tumors and normal prostates. By using RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR, we found that <em>Hes1 </em>expression in NE-10 tumors was diminished whereas <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>expression was correspondingly increased (Figure <a name="d11647e1053"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8A</a> and <a name="d11647e1056"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8B</a>). The majority of NE-10 tumors also showed an increased expression of <em>E2F1 </em>(Figure <a name="d11647e1063"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8A</a>, left panel). However, when <em>E2F1 </em>levels from all NE-10 tumors were examined collectively by real-time qRT-PCR, they were quite variable; it did not show statistically
   significant differences between the NE-10 tumors and normal prostate specimens (Figure <a name="d11647e1069"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8B</a>, n = 12). A closer examination led us to find that, among the 11 NE-10 tumors in which Hes1 expression was already very low,
   <em>E2F1 </em>transcription was relatively high when <em>Hes1 </em>level was correspondingly high (Figure <a name="d11647e1079"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8C</a>). When the <em>E2F1 </em>transcription was relatively low, <em>Hes1 </em>expression was extremely low (Figure <a name="d11647e1088"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F8">8C</a>). These results were consistent with the notion that the changes of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in NE-10 tumors could be the result
   of coordinated regulation of <em>Hes1 </em>and <em>E2F1 </em>expression.

<p>Because <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase inhibitor DAPT reduced Hes1 level in prostate cancer cell lines <a name="d11647e1159"></a>[<a href="#B19">19</a>] (see also Figure <a name="d11647e1162"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F7">7</a>), we sought to explore whether the <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase inhibition-mediated increases in <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression is accompanied by phenotypic
   changes with implications of neuroendocrine alterations. We examined the cell cycle profiles and the morphology of PC3 cells.
   After treatment with DAPT, there were no significant changes in G1 or SubG1 populations when compared to control PC3 cells
   (Figure <a name="d11647e1165"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F9">9A</a>). However, there were significant increases (<em>p </em>&lt; 0.05) in cell number in the S phase with corresponding decreases in the G2/M populations, indicating a delay in S/G2 transition
   (Figure <a name="d11647e1171"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F9">9A</a>). Similar results were obtained in additional experiments using another <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase inhibitor WPE-III-31C, although its effects
   were more moderate (Figure <a name="d11647e1175"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F9">9A</a>).

<p>PC3 cells in rapid growth phase showed typical epithelial cell morphology (Figure <a name="d11647e1196"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F9">9B</a>). However, PC3 cells treated with DAPT or WPE-III-31C for 48 hours altered cell morphology. They displayed increased number
   of cells with elongated shape or with extended cellular protrusions (Figure <a name="d11647e1199"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F9">9C</a>, DAPT; Figure <a name="d11647e1202"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F9">9D</a>, WPE-III-31C; see arrows). These results are consistent with previously reported functions of Hes1 and <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin and support
   a role of Hes1 suppression and <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in neuroendocrine tumor progression <a name="d11647e1206"></a><a name="d11647e1208"></a><a name="d11647e1210"></a>[<a href="#B21">21</a>-<a href="#B23">23</a>].
</p>
<a name="sec3"></a><h3>Discussion</h3>
<p><span class="entity">δ</span>-Catenin expression is upregulated in most human prostatic adenocarcinomas <a name="d11647e1220"></a>[<a href="#B6">6</a>] and other epithelial cancers <a name="d11647e1224"></a>[<a href="#B5">5</a>]. Recently, Pax6 and E2F1 were identified as positive transcriptional regulators for <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in the central nervous system
   <a name="d11647e1228"></a>[<a href="#B24">24</a>] and in prostate cancer cells <a name="d11647e1232"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>]. However, whether there are pivotal negative transcriptional regulators for <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>and how they may coordinate with positive regulators to control <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression are unknown.
</p>
<p>Transcriptional factor binding consensus analysis using Genomatix program <a href="http://www.genomatix.de/">http://www.genomatix.de/</a> <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query.php?url=http://www.genomatix.de/&amp;refdoi=10.1186/1476-4598-9-304" alt="" title="Archive copy of webpage" class="xpushbutton">webcite</a> revealed that <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter region contains potential binding sites of negative transcriptional regulators, RBP-Jkappa, Hes1, and p53 <a name="d11647e1247"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>]. We have found that PC3 and CWR22-Rv1 are two prostate tumor cell lines with relatively high expression levels of both <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin
   and Hes1.
</p>
<p>While a single transcription activator or repressor less likely controls <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in prostate cancer cells, our
   current study supports the notion that Hes1 could negatively regulate the expression of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in prostate cancer cells.
   Similar to the positive effects of E2F1 <a name="d11647e1253"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>], Hes1 acts negatively on <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression in a dose-dependent manner.
</p>
<p>Hes1 expression is downregulated in non-metastatic cancer cell LNCaP compared with that in metastatic cancer cell C4-2B and
   may act as a tumor suppressor for primary prostate tumorigenesis <a name="d11647e1259"></a><a name="d11647e1261"></a>[<a href="#B19">19</a>,<a href="#B25">25</a>]. In breast and pancreatic endocrine tumors, Hes1 was also downregulated <a name="d11647e1265"></a><a name="d11647e1267"></a>[<a href="#B16">16</a>,<a href="#B17">17</a>]. However, in some tumors, Hes1 is upregulated during tumorigenesis, such as osteosarcomas <a name="d11647e1271"></a><a name="d11647e1273"></a>[<a href="#B26">26</a>,<a href="#B27">27</a>]. As tumorigenesis is further underway, gene expression in cancer cells is deregulated and seems to be very complex and multi-faceted
   in nature. Hes1 may thus act as a tumor suppressor in one context and as an oncogene in another depending on the tumor types
   and the stages of cancer progression.
</p>
<p>Notch-Hes1 axis in signaling is intricately modulated to control proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis <a name="d11647e1279"></a>[<a href="#B28">28</a>]. Hes1 is a target of Notch1 signaling, which is aberrantly activated in a variety of human cancers, including prostate, lung,
   colorectal, osteogenic, and breast carcinomas <a name="d11647e1283"></a><a name="d11647e1285"></a><a name="d11647e1287"></a><a name="d11647e1289"></a><a name="d11647e1291"></a>[<a href="#B12">12</a>,<a href="#B13">13</a>,<a href="#B26">26</a>,<a href="#B29">29</a>,<a href="#B30">30</a>]. Hes1 may also contribute to osteoblast growth and differentiation by controlling transcription directly through interactions
   with transcriptional regulators <a name="d11647e1295"></a>[<a href="#B30">30</a>]. The relationship between the aberrant expression of Hes1, E2F1, and <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin in tumorigenesis is quite complex <em>in vivo </em>as well. In NE-10 neuroendocrine tumors <a name="d11647e1302"></a>[<a href="#B20">20</a>] where <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression was increased, Hes1 expression was diminished and E2F1 expression was increased. However, the
   extent of Hes1 reduction and E2F1 upregulation appeared to be tightly controlled in NE-10 tumors to avoid a complete shutdown
   of Hes1 expression with an overwhelming upregulation of E2F1 at the same time. One consequence of this coordination is for
   tumor cells to watch closely the expression level of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin during tumor progression. Therefore, it is possible that <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin
   expression in NE-10 tumor is regulated both by its positive and negative transcriptional regulators.
</p>
<p>These findings may have important functional implications for gene deregulation in tumor progression. It is well documented
   that Myc oncoprotein can activate E2F transcription factor, which can initiate both cell proliferation and apoptosis <a name="d11647e1308"></a>[<a href="#B31">31</a>]. Earlier studies found that E2F1 transgenic mice showed increases in spontaneous tumor formation in the skin, but they also
   displayed an inhibition of tumor promotion by <em>O</em>-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) <a name="d11647e1315"></a>[<a href="#B32">32</a>]. A closer examination of E2F1 expression using tissue microarray found that E2F1 was low in benign and localized prostate
   cancer, modestly elevated in metastatic lymph nodes from hormone-naive patients, and significantly elevated in metastatic
   tissues from hormone-resistant prostate cancer patients <a name="d11647e1319"></a>[<a href="#B33">33</a>]. These studies suggest that in the early stages of prostate cancer development, E2F1 may be kept low to allow its oncogenic
   effects to be best accomplished with the cooperation of other oncogenic proteins, such as Myc, to outweigh its potential apoptotic
   effects. Quite interestingly, <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression increased correspondingly from Gleason 4 to 6 and peaked at Gleason 8 prostatic
   adenocarcinomas, but reduced somewhat at Gleason 10 tumors, although its overall level was still higher than that of non-cancer
   prostatic tissues <a name="d11647e1323"></a>[<a href="#B6">6</a>]. It is possible that in individual human prostate cancer cases, simultaneously higher <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin and E2F1 expression level
   during early cancer development is not beneficial for tumor growth. On the other hand, an unusually high <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin as well
   as E2F1 expression <a name="d11647e1328"></a>[<a href="#B33">33</a>] could indicate the aggressiveness of tumor progression as they could signal that the tumors have already passed the very
   early stage of the oncogenic buildup.

<a name="sec4"></a><h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Our study shows that human homolog of <em>Drosophila </em>Hes1 negatively regulates <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin (<em>CTNND2</em>) expression, alters cell cycle progression, and influences neuroendocrine-like cell morphology. These studies support coordinated
   regulation of <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin expression by both the activating transcription factor E2F1 and repressive transcription factor Hes1
   in prostate cancer progression.
</p>
<a name="sec5"></a><h3>Methods</h3>
<h4>Plasmids</h4>
<p>The <em>Hes1 </em>expression plasmids (<em>pcDNA-flag-WT-Hes1</em>, <em>pcDNA-flag-DN-Hes1</em>), which contain rat <em>Hes1 </em>gene and the plasmid for <em>E2F1</em>, were described previously <a name="d11647e1370"></a><a name="d11647e1372"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>,<a href="#B18">18</a>]. The construction of human <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin</em>-luciferase reporter vectors (BK1 and BK5), based on pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega), was previously reported <a name="d11647e1379"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>]. pSV-<span class="entity">β</span>-Galactosidase control vector (Promega) or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used as a control vector.
</p>
<p>In <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin-luciferase </em>reporter vector BK5 (containing 744 bp of <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter) <a name="d11647e1391"></a>[<a href="#B10">10</a>], there are four E-boxes (position in -425 to -437, -432 to -442, -493 to -506, and -631 to -643), which are potential binding
   sites for Hes1 (Figure <a name="d11647e1394"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1A</a>). These four E-boxes in <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter were mutated via site-directed gene mutagenesis one by one. The E-box in position -631 to -643 was mutated from ACGcgcgCGGCGA
   to ACGatatCGGCGA using mutation primer set (5'- CAGGAGAAGTGGA<u>ACGatatCGGCGA</u>AGCGCCGCT-3' and AGCGGCGCT<u>TCGCCGatatCGT</u>TCCACTTCTCCTG). The obtained PCR product using wild BK5 vector as template was digested with DpnI, cloned to DH5<span class="entity">α</span> bacteria,
   and sequenced. The sequencing confirmed mutant BK5-M1 was used as template to mutate the second E-box at position -494 to
   -506, from CTGCcgcgCGCCG to CTGCatatCGCCG, using primer set (5'-GGAGGCTGAGG<u>CTGCatatCGCCG</u>CGGGAGGAG-3' and 5'- CTCCTCCCG<u>CGGCGatatGCAG</u>CCTCAGCCTCC-3'). The resulted mutant (BK5-M1, 2) vector mutated in the above two E-boxes was then used as template to mutate
   the third and fourth E-boxes at positions -425 to -437 and -432 to -442 using primer set (5'-AGGTGGCGC<u>GGGCCGCatatGGGGCGC</u>AGCTCGGGA-3' and 5'- TCCCGAGCT<u>GCGCCCCatatGCGGCCC</u>GCGCCACCT-3') from GGGCCGCcgcgGGGGCGC to GGGCCGCatatGGGGCGC. The final BK5-M1, 2, 3 mutant (BK5Mu) contains a 744 bp <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter mutated in all known 4 E-boxes and was used to evaluate the binding ability of Hes1 in <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter.
</p>
<h4>Antibodies</h4>
<p>The antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin Delta-30 (BD Bioscience), rabbit polyclonal anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin
   antibody R1152 raised against 435-530 amino acid and affinity purified essentially as described <a name="d11647e1433"></a>[<a href="#B3">3</a>], rabbit anti-Hes1 polyclonal antibody (Millipore), mouse anti-flag antibody M5 (Kodak), mouse monoclonal anti-actin (Calbiochem),
   and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH mAb (6C5) (Calbiochem). Mouse monoclonal anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin/NPRAP/Neurojungin (J19) was a gift
   from Dr. Werner Franke.
</p>
<h4>Cell culture, transfection and siRNA against Hes1</h4>
<p>CWR22-Rv1 and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines, as well as PZ-HPV-7 normal prostate cell lines were from ATCC and maintained
   in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (CWR22-Rv1 and PC3), or in Keratinocyte-SFM media
   supplemented with EGF, bovine pituitary extract, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PZ-HPV-7) at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) or Fugene 6 reagent (Roche) according to
   the manufacturer's instructions. For Hes1 knockdown experiments, specific siRNAs directed against human <em>Hes1 </em>nucleotide sequences were obtained from Darmacon Technologies (USA). The ON-target plus smart siRNA oligonucleotide sequences
   were as follows: ACGAGAGCAAGAAUAAAU, AGGCUGGAGAGGCGGCUAA, UCAACACGACACCGGAUAA, and ACUGCAUGACCCAGAUCAA. A scramble siRNA was
   used as control.
</p>
<h4>
<span class="entity">γ</span>-Secretase inhibitor treatment and flow cytometry</h4>
<p>Inhibition of endogenous Hes1 in PC3 and CWR22-Rv1 cell lines was achieved by a 48-hour treatment of 20 <span class="entity">μ</span>M DAPT (N- [N-(3,
   5-difluorophenylacetyl- L -alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) (Calbiochem), a peptidomimetic inhibitor of <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase.
   Control plates were treated using the solvent DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) (Sigma) with the same final concentration. For cell
   morphology and flow cytometry analyses, PC3 cells were incubated with 20 <span class="entity">μ</span>M DAPT, 300 nM WPE-III-31C (a transition-state analog
   of <span class="entity">γ</span>-secretase) <a name="d11647e1455"></a><a name="d11647e1457"></a>[<a href="#B34">34</a>,<a href="#B35">35</a>], or DMSO (control), respectively for 48 hours. Cells in multiple areas of culture plates were photographed for morphological
   analyses before they were collected with mild trypsinization and centrifugation. Cells were fixed in ice-cold ethanol and
   stained with 50 <span class="entity">μ</span>g/ml propidium iodide containing RNase in the dark. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle
   (SubG1, G1, S, and G2/M) was determined by flow cytometry on a FACScan (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) with ModFit 3.1 software
   (Varity Software House, Topsham, ME). All data was presented as mean ± SEM and statistically evaluated with <em>t</em>-test. The confidence level was set at 95%.
</p>
<h4>Luciferase reporter assay</h4>
<p>Cell cultures in 12-well plates were transiently transfected using Fugene 6 reagent with expression vectors for several genes
   (<em>E2F1, WT-Hes1 </em>or <em>DN-Hes1</em>, luciferase gene, <em>GAL</em>) as indicated in the result section. Luciferase activity was measured 24 hours after transfection using the Luciferase Assay
   system (Promega) and normalized to <span class="entity">β</span>-galactosidase activity, which was used as control to determine transfection efficiency.
   All experiments were performed in quintuplicates. Whenever errors were displayed they represented standard deviation of mean
   (SDM) except in cell cycle measurements where SEM was employed.
</p>
<h4>Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA)</h4>
<p>Nuclear extracts were prepared from PC3 or CWR22-Rv1 cells transfected with <em>pcDNA-flag-WT-Hes1 </em>using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche) 24 h before preparation according to instructions for NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
   Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Oligonucleotides containing the HLH motif derived in <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter (5'-GGGCGAAGGCCCAGAGGCCTTCCTTGG<u>CACATG</u>TTTTGGGTTTCGTTTTTCAACAAGACT-3') [the E-box/HLH motif is underlined] (marked as ** in Figure <a name="d11647e1493"></a><a href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/304/figure/F1">1A</a>) and its reverse complement sequences were 3'-end labeled separately with Biotin 3' End DNA Labeling Kit (Pierce Biotechnology,
   Rockford, IL) and then annealed. Unlabeled shorter oligonucleotides (CCTTCCTTGG<u>CACATG</u>TTTTGGGTT) [the E-box/HLH motif is underlined] and its reverse complement sequences were annealed and used as competitors.
   Mutant probe was produced when E-box sequence <u>CACATG </u>was mutated to <u>GTCTCA</u>. EMSA reactions were performed according to instructions of LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
   IL). Nuclear protein extracts (2 <span class="entity">μ</span>l) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 <span class="entity">μ</span>l of non-specific competitor DNA
   Poly (dI·dC) and 20 fmol of biotin-labeled oligonucleotides. Competition assays were performed by mixing non-specific competitor
   DNA with 4 pmol unlabeled oligonucleotides (200-fold molar excess) and nuclear extracts before addition of probes. Hes-1 antibody
   (2 <span class="entity">μ</span>l; Santa Cruz, CA) was used for disrupt-shift experiments. Normal goat IgG, Pax-6 antibody (2ul; Santa Cruz, CA), and
   <span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin antibody (2 <span class="entity">μ</span>l; Transduction Laboratory, BD Biosciences) were used as a non-specific antibody. Antibodies were mixed
   with nuclear protein on ice for 20 min before the addition of probe DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were run on a 6% acrylamide
   gel, electrophoretically transferred to nylon membrane and visualized by Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce
   Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).
</p>
<h4>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</h4>
<p>PC3 cells were collected and ChIP assay was performed to test Hes1 protein regulation on <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter using the Abcam ChIP kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cross-linking was performed
   by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% at room temperature for 10 minutes and reaction stopped by the addition
   of 125 mM glycine. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1 mM PMSF. Cell pellets, collected
   by centrifugation at 2000 rpm at 4°C, were resuspended in 1 ml of ChIP sonication buffer. DNA was sheared by sonication and
   the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 15 minutes. The pre-cleared whole cell extract was incubated
   with or without the antibodies, as described in the legend, at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitated, immune complexes were collected
   using anti-Hes 1 conjugated-Protein A. Anti-Histone 3 (ab1791) antibody and IgG were used as positive control and negative
   control, respectively. The primer sets of real-time PCR for <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin </em>promoter were as follows: Forward: 5'-CCTTCCAGCTTTCGCCTA G-3', Reverse: 5'-TCCACTTCTCCTGGTTTTCG-3'; GAPDH was used as control,
   the primers were as follows: Forward: 5'-AGAAACAGGAGGTCCCTACTCCC-3', Reverse: 5'-AGAGCGCGAAAGGAAAGA AAG CGT -3'.
</p>
<h4>Mouse tissue preparation</h4>
<p>The development of mouse neuroendocrine tumors (NE-10) was described before <a name="d11647e1525"></a>[<a href="#B14">14</a>]. Male CD1 mice (Charles River Lab, Wilmington, MA) were obtained and used at 10 weeks of age. Mice were kept under pathogen
   free conditions and sacrificed by cervical dislocation according to the guidelines of East Carolina University Animal Use
   Protocol. The prostates were dissected into three different lobes (ventral, lateral-dorsal, and anterior lobe) under a dissecting
   microscope.
</p>
<h4>Immunohistochemistry</h4>
<p>For NE-10 and CD-1 mice prostate tissue immunohistochemistry, 5 <span class="entity">μ</span>m tissue sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks
   were deparaffinized and rehydrated; endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation with hydrogen peroxide. The sections were
   immunostained using rabbit anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin R1152 (1:100) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) followed by streptavidin-biotin peroxidase
   method for detection. The immunostaining was done in Dako Autostainer (Carpinteria, CA) according to the manufacture instruction.
</p>
<h4>RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR</h4>
<p>Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells or mouse tissues using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with residual genomic DNA
   removed by RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) treatment. 1~2 <span class="entity">μ</span>g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Retroscript reverse transcription
   kit (Applied Biosystems).
</p>
<p>For RT-PCR, the reaction was initiated using Advantage 2 polymerase or Advantage-GC 2 polymerase (Clontech). The following
   forward and reverse primers were used to produce gene specific fragments: human <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin</em>, forward 5'-ATGTTTGCGAGGAAGCCGC-3' and reverse 5'-GTCTGGTTGCTATGGTAGCTGGC-3'; mouse <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin</em>, forward 5'-GAGCTATGCCTGTCCCAGAC-3' and reverse 5'-AGCTGAGAAGGGGCTGTGT-3'; human <em>Hes1</em>, forward 5'-CAGCGAGTGCATGAACGAGGTGA-3' and reverse 5'- AGGTGCCGCTGTTGCTGGTGTAGA-3'; mouse <em>Hes1</em>, forward 5'-AAGAGGCGAAGGGCAAGAATAAAT-3' and reverse 5'-CCGGGGATGGGCACAAG-3'; rat <em>Hes1</em>, 5'-ACAGCCTCTGAGCACAGAAAGTCA-3' and reverse 5'-TGAGGAAAGCAAATTGGCCGTCAG-3'; human <em>Hey1</em>, forward 5'- TCGAGTTCGACTGGTTTCGCATCT-3' and reverse 5'- AGGTCTATAGGGCTTGCCAAGGTT-3'; human <em>E2F1</em>, forward 5'-ACTCCTCGCAGATCGTCATCATCT-3' and reverse 5'-GGACGTTGGTGATGTCATAGATGCG-3'; mouse E2F1, forward 5'-GCATCCAGCTCATTGCCAAGAAGT-3'
   and reverse 5'-TGGTGACAGTTGGTCCTCTTCCAT-3'; human <em>LEF-1</em>, forward 5'-CCCGCTTCCGCCCGCTGTCC-3' and reverse 5'-CGGGGTGTTCTCTGGCCTTGTCGT-3'; human <em>p53</em>, forward 5'-AGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAA-3' and reverse 5'-CCCCGGGACAAAGCAAATGGAAGT-3'; human <em>CDK8</em>, forward 5'-AGAAGCTGCTTACCATGGACCCAA-3' and reverse 5'- TGGTGGAACTTGGCTACTGGACAT-3'; <em>human androgen receptor (AR)</em>, 5'-AGACGCTTCTACCAGCTCACCAA-3' and 5'- AGCTCTCTAAACTTCCCGTGGCAT-3'; human c-<em>Myc</em>, forward TCCACACATCAGCACAACTACGCA and reverse TCAGCCAAGGTTGTGAGGTTGCAT; human <em>GAPDH </em>(as control), forward 5'-GGGGAGCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCT-3' and reverse 5'- GACGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3'; mouse <em>GAPDH </em>(as control), forward 5'-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3' and reverse 5'- TGTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGTG-3'. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis
   in 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination.
</p>
<p>For real time qPCR, reaction was initiated using IQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad) in an iCycler iQ Multicolor Detection System
   (Bio-Rad). The relative mRNA levels of tested genes were calculated against control <em>GAPDH</em>. The following primers for real time qPCR were used: mouse <em><span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin</em>, forward 5'- ACCTCGGGAAATGATCAGCCTCAA-3' and reverse 5'- TAGTTCCGTGGTAAGTGGCGTTGT-3'; mouse <em>Hes1</em>, forward 5'- CAACACGACACCGGACAAACCAAA-3' and reverse 5'- TGGAATGCCGGGAGCTATCTTTCT-3'; mouse <em>E2F1</em>, forward 5'-TCATGCCAGGAGACATCC-3' and reverse 5'-CAATACTGCTTCTTGCTCCA-3'; mouse <em>c-Myc</em>, forward 5'- TGCTGCATGAGGAGACA -3' and reverse 5'-TCGGGATGGAGATGAGC-3'; mouse <em>AR</em>, forward 5'- CTGCCTGATCTGTGGAGA-3' and reverse 5'- CAATGGTACAATCGTTTCTGC-3'; mouse <em>CDK8</em>, forward 5'- ACATTCTGGTACCGAGCT-3' and reverse 5'- CACCCTATAGCCCAAATATCAA-3'; and mouse <em>GAPDH </em>(as control), forward 5'-TCAACAGCAACTCCCACTCTTCCA-3' and reverse 5'- ACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTCA-3'. The real-time PCR primer
   set for human genes were: human <em><strong><span class="entity">δ</span>-</strong>catenin</em>, forward 5'-GCCTCAGTCAAAGAACAGGA-3'and reverse 5'-AGCTTGCATCGCTCCA-3'; human <em>Hes1</em>, forward 5'-CTGAAGAAAGATAGCTCGCG-3' and reverse 5'-ACTTCCCCAGCACACTT-3'; human <em>E2F1</em>, forward 5'- CTCCGAGGACACTGACA-3' and reverse 5'- CACCATAACCATCTGCTCTG-3'; human <em>GAPDH</em>, forward 5'-ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTT-3' and 5'-GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC-3'.

<h4>Immunofluorescence light microscopy</h4>
<p>Cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked
   with 10% BSA in PBS, double immunostained with mouse anti-flag antibody M5 (1:600)/secondary antibody mouse Cy3 (1:400) and
   then rabbit polyclonal anti-<span class="entity">δ</span>-catenin antibody R1152 (1:50)/secondary antibody rabbit FITC (1:100). The nuclei were counter
   stained with Hoechst 33258 (2 <span class="entity">μ</span>g/ml). The slides were mounted using Molecular Probe's Antifade medium and were analyzed under
   Zeiss Axiovert inverted fluorescent light microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).
</p>
<h4>Western blot</h4>
<p>Cultured cells were lysed in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS with
   protease inhibitor cocktails. Equal amounts of protein samples were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE. After proteins were transferred
   to nitrocellulose membranes (PGC Scientifics), Western blots were performed with appropriate antibodies and developed with
   ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham).
